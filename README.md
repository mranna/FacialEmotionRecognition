# FacialEmotionRecognition

The goal of this work is to design 2 neural network models able to
work with a training set of 10 pictures and from it correctly identify 2
users in particular. I designed my networks by providing datasets from
40 pictures Kaggle and 20 pictures of my personal pictures. The results
show an Equal Error Rate of 15% for the CNN model vs an ERR of 22.5% for
my AutoEncoder model. The proposed techniques use simple facial
recognition techniques to extract feature points from input test images
and comparing them to a trained dataset. I am able to get an
average accuracy but have thought of ways to improve our model and go
beyond our initial scope and implement an emotion identification feature
in the future.
